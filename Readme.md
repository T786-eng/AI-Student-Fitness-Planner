# 🥗 AI-Personalized Student Fitness Planner
**An AI-driven solution for budget-friendly workout and diet planning.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed for the **Edunet (IBM SkillsBuild) Internship** final submission. 

### The Problem
Most fitness applications provide generic plans that are:
1. **Too Expensive:** Recommending supplements and gym memberships students can't afford.
2. **Culturally Limited:** Not accounting for specific dietary habits (like pure vegetarian needs).
3. **Time Consuming:** Complex routines that don't fit a student's busy schedule.

### The Solution
This AI-powered planner uses a recommendation engine to generate **practical, budget-friendly, and culturally relevant** fitness routines. It filters data based on your specific goals, dietary preferences, and available budget.
